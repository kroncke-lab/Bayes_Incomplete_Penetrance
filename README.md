Providing quantitative estimates of disease probability given the presence of a variant in a disease-associated gene is a major challenge in contemporary genetics. We elaborate a method to construct continuous estimates of Long QT Syndrome Type 1 for all single nucleotide variants in KCNQ1.
This method relies on observations of affected and unaffected heterozygotes from literature reports, population databases of putatively healthy controls, and detailed phenotyping from international arrhythmia genetics centers.
Our approach supplements heterozygote observations with variant-specific features: functional data from channel electrophysiology, structural parameters obtained from cryo-EM, and various 'in silico' predictors of variant pathogenicity. 
We integrate these lines of evidence using a Bayesian approach and expectation-maximization. 
Crucially, this approach explicitly acknowledges incompleete penetrance in providing a probability of disease given the variant and a defined uncertainty associated with that estimate. A severe limitation of current variant-interpretation strategies is the inconsistency of categorical descriptions, where Pathogenic variants may variably affect heterozygotes, and LQTS may nevertheless manifest in Benign variant heterozygotes.
